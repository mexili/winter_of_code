## Skribbl
**Project Description**: Skribbl is a web-based app that allows free-hand scribbling of virtual t-shirts via freehand drawing on canvas or adding by adding text through a textbox. You can also view the skribbl history that highlights the selected skribbl. You can share your t-shirt on various social media platforms with your friends. This project was made for students graduating in pandemic so that they can have scribble ceremonies online.

The basic project is built. We plan to add multiple features on the basic template.

**Difficulty**: Easy/Medium

**Tasks to do**:

\1. Add options for multiple T-shirts for a single user so that a user does never run out of canvas space.

\2. Add authentication support for different social media platforms.

\3. Add virtual rooms so that instead of sharing links, you can look at the list of people in the room and scribble on their e-shirts.

\4. Add personalization for users like background themes, T-Shirt themes, etc.

\5. If time permits, we would like to create a zero knowledge server to securely save the details on the backend with end to end encryption.

**Requirements**: ReactJS (preferred), Firebase, Node.js, Basic server-side knowledge.

## Incogly: An anonymous Video platform
**Project Description**: Incog.ly is a peer to peer video conferencing app which keeps your identity anonymous. With the feel by avatarifying the remote side into a character with the power of emotions and expressions. 
**Difficulty**: Medium/Hard

**Tasks to do**:

\1. To add multi device and multi browser support

\2. Server side machine learning will replace client side machine learning

\3. Add the feature of adding rooms in incogly

\4. Add the feature of adding audio anonymisation using frequency analysis of audio

\5. Create an automated deployment pipeline with tests for the above work

**Requirements**: ReactJS , NodeJS, (good to have) Rust(WASM) and TensorflowJS

## CSSify: A framework to develop custom CSS frameworks
**Project Description**: Scaffold your own CSS framework in seconds! Using CSS frameworks always comes with a trade-off - you need to choose between a steep learning curve, limited feature sets, and large file sizes. While preprocessors like Sass improved modularity, overcoming all three obstacles at once seems to be a challenge.
CSSify provides a solution to all these problems, by offering a rock solid base which is customisable in all its aspects. Common tasks such as defining layouts, brand colors, spacing utilities, breakpoints, typography, etc can now be completed with a few clicks with a live preview- enormously boosting your creative speed.

**Difficulty**: Easy/Medium

**Tasks to do**:

\1. To convert the library to a BEM focused version.

\2. Add a feature to generate prebuilt custom components alongside the declarative model.

\3. Improve the live preview system to reduce the lag due to prop drilling  

\4. To reduce the bundle size by reducing the dependencies

\5. If time permits, create a custom deployment pipeline.

**Requirements**: ReactJS , CSS/SCSS(required),  NodeJS, (good to have) and TensorflowJS

## Aiden
**Project Description**: Aiden is a web app utilising *tensorflow.js*, browser-based Machine Learning library, to enable accessible physiotherapy for the Visually Impaired and other people as well - talking through exercises and by responding to users' postures in real-time.

**Difficulty**: Medium/Hard

The basic project is built. We plan to add multiple features on the basic template.

**Tasks to do**:

\1. Use better pose calculation algorithms

\2. Setting up of a basic backend ( authentication, leaderboard ). 

\3. Adding new teachable machine pose models. 

\4. Using WebRTC and Socket.io for multiple users to join. 

\5. Refactoring code using Typescript and React

\6. Add a testing suite for components using Jest.

**Requirements**: Typescript, React, NodeJS, Jest, TensorflowJS,  basic server side knowledge
